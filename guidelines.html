              <dd> There are no entry fees and you do not need a ticket to attend. Our markets are free entry! </dd>
            <dt> <i> Parking </i></dt>
              <dd> There will be free parking at the market, but please be mindful that you park in a proper space.</dd>
            <dt> <i> Family Friendly </i></dt>
              <dd> Our venue is very family friendly! There will be a variety of vendors and activities for everyone so we encourage you to bring out the whole family to enjoy the market together.</dd>
            <dt> <i> Pet Friendly </i></dt>
              <dd> Our venue is pet friendly too! However, we are not liable for your pet's adventures. We recommend only bringing out your well-behaved pets to maintain safety and ensure good vibes throughout the event.</dd>

            <dt> <i> Applications </i></dt>
              <dd> When filling out an application, please be sure to fill out the correct one that pertains to you. There are applications for vendors who sell products, food vendors, and vendors who provide a service/form of entertainment. We appreciate all the applications that come in, but unfortunately cannot accept everyone. If your application does not get approved for one market, we would still love to see your application again for ones in the future.</dd>
            <dt> <i> Turnout </i></dt>
              <dd> Every market is a wildcard as to what the turnout will be. We are constantly hustling from flyers to social media, however, we still never know for sure what will happen. We encourage you to also help bring in the crowd through deals, coupons, or freebies!</dd>
            <dt> <i> Features </i></dt>
              <dd> We do no charge to feature any of our vendors on any of our platforms. However, we unfortunately cannot post about everyone as we have 60-80 vendors every market. We track who has been posted and always aim to mix it up to keep things fresh.</dd>
            <dt> <i> Equipment </i></dt>
              <dd> If you do not have a tent or simply do not want to deal with the hassle of setting and cleaning up, we collaborate with a tent rental business who can assist you. You may find information about the options through the application.</dd>
            <dt> <i> Electricity/Outlets </i></dt>
              <dd> We are an outdoor market so there will be no source of electrical power accessible. If needed, we recommend bringing a small generator.</dd>
